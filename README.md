# Advent of code 2024
Just solve the damn problem üôè
It's my messy and raw solution for this year calendar.

## What to expect?

- It's not clean, I know.
- It's not optimized, _I know._
- It's not always pretty. **But it works!**
- This is not a way to learning something, **I... no, that's not true!**

## Why this approach?
Have you ever tried writing JavaScript directly in the console? Yes, [Chrome's Snippets](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/devtools-tips-26/) count too.

Forget IDEs, you're on your own, alone, you will learn the hard way...

You can easily lose an hour (I did, on day 2) because you forgot something so basic that there is [nothing left to do but cry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087814/).

## How to run?
1. Open your browser's DevTools console.
2. Paste the JavaScript snippet for the day's challenge.
3. Hit Enter and see the results (or debug until you do).
